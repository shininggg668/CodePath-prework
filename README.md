New Idea:
I would like to build an app that combines healthy eating with beginner-friendly fitness guidance. 
The app would provide easy and delicious low-calorie recipes, showing detailed calorie counts and step-by-step instructions. 
It would also offer beginner workout videos for goals like weight loss and strength training. 
In addition, users could continuously input their daily calorie intake, exercise activities, and weight. 
Based on this data, the app would help generate personalized diet and workout plans to guide users toward their goals. 
There would also be a community section where users can share recipes, workout tips, and motivation.
